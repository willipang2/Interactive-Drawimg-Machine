# Interactive Drawing Machine

Now, people are constantly consuming different things. Each purchase is accompanied by a receipt, which has made me wonder: what is the meaning of a receipt? A receipt rationally records our consumption behaviour, but is our consumption behaviour rational?

By inviting the audience to place a receipt on a drawing machine, the machine learning model will identify the purchased items and generate corresponding images, which are then drawn onto the receipt. Provoking them to reflect on consuming.
